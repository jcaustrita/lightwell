			<p>A blend of 63% Riesling and 37% Petit Manseng. A buffalo hunt takes its party far off the beaten path into an uncharted, snow-covered forest. A moonlit clearing reveals a gnarled, once fruit-bearing tree, sheltering the elusive target. And in that moment they realize – despite the thrill of the hunt – they were chasing something else all along.</p>
			<p>Lightwell Survey’s most complex wine is a blend of Ox-Eye Riesling and Petit Manseng from winemaker Ben Jordan’s family vineyard – and the mash up is something bold. Fat and waxy like a Chenin Blanc, honeycomb and apricot dominate the nose while tropical fruit and bracing acid take on the palate. Hintermen doesn’t joke around. It’ll last a while in the cellar too. 51 cases produced.</p>
