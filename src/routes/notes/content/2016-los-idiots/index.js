			<p>A blend of 55% Syrah and 45% Riesling. Another year older, another year wiser? With more grapes than ever heading to the press it’s hard for a clown to get any shut eye nowadays. Production marches on to the beat of a different drum and los idiots continue to think outside the box about what’s inside the barrel. Sometimes it’s better to listen to your gut instead of your head.</p>
			<p>This one is a battle for the senses. Smells like a holiday party at mom’s house. Somehow neither grape dominates the nose but both shine. At the same time red fruits and citrus jump out, like if a plum and a meyer lemon had a baby. A plemon, it smells like a fat plemon.  Its on the palette that the syrah makes itself known in soft subtle tannins, we think it works. 48 cases produced.</p>
