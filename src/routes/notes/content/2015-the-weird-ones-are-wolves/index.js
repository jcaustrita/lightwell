			<p>A blend of 97% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Manseng. This one’s for the weirdos. For the wolves in wolves’ clothings (paired with the occasional trench coat). For the ones who feel more comfortable walking through a dark alley than a bustling city street. After all, a wolf doesn’t concern itself with the opinions of sheep.</p>
			<p><i>The Weird Ones are Wolves</i> is a bit more serious. The blend is a subtle nod to Cote-Rotie. The Cabernet Franc leaps out of the glass with its dry cranberry fruit while the honey of the Manseng rounds out the edges. The blend brings an elegant and lush palate that drinks more like a traditional red, while soft tannins and bright acid keep things lively. It’s ready for a long life in the cellar but perfect for dinner tonight. 75 cases produced.</p>
