			<p>100% Riesling. Wild horses are unbridled and fiercely independent, but still prefer to exist within a group. Theyâ€™re a powerful embodiment of the natural conflict between beauty and violence, even in the most serene environments.</p>
			<p>From Ox-Eye Vineyards, <i>Goodbye Horses</i> is a charismatic representation of a dry Riesling. In Virginia, grapes grown at higher elevations ripen later in the season and preserve their acidity. Shenandoah Valley Rieslings are distinct from the rest of the world in that they can be dry, with strong yet balanced acidity (at less than 12% abv). The nose pushes hard on fresh Granny Smith apple and white flower elements, while the palate dials up the acidity. This wine will leave you wanting more. 55 cases produced.</p>
