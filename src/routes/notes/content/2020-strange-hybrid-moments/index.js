			<p>A blend of 33% Vidal blanc, 22% Chambourcin, 21% Blaufränkisch, 17% Petit Manseng, and 7% Traminette. 275 cases produced. What an interesting color, a rose rim and a copper core. The scent is just as different. Sweet rose petal and red apple skin blend with wet soil & river rocks. If my eyes were closed, Im not sure I would say this were a rosé. It even has soft tannin and red berry fruit on the palate. Easy and soft for a lazy mid-day glass.</p>
