			<p>100% Blaufränkisch Rosé. Warm weather was made for escaping to the water and rosé was always made light pink, but the unexpected is always lurking just under the surface. There’s never much you can do when it rears it’s head, pops out and grabs you except drink up. When things don’t seem normal, that’s where the real adventure lives.</p>
			<p>True to name, it’s as dark as these days. Don’t let the deep dark color fool you, it’s a live wire. Ripe red fruit bouncing all over and the palate is a ride you wont forget. Are you drinking red wine? Nah man, it’s fresh, bright, it’s dancing. Easy drinking here kids – get after it. 114 cases produced.</p>
