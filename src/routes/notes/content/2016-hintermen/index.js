			<p>A blend of 72% Riesling and 28% Petit Manseng. Has the hunter already become the hunted? As the hintermen march on the untamed wild pushes back as the once peaceful scenery turns territorial towards the uninvited travelers and the wildlife begins to come to life. The risk and reward of these uncharted lands might both be too great to turn back now.</p>
			<p>“Holy Shit!” This is somehow at the same time full and fleshy while bursting with minerality and acidity. Built to age like last year but for different reasons. This is racy and sleek like that silver Delorian you’ve been been dreaming of since the 80’s. Somewhere between old school wax candies filled with weird juice and Warheads, this is a visceral experience. Hold on to your seat. 165 cases produced.</p>
