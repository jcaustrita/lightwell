			<p>A blend of 72% Riesling and 28% Petit Manseng. If we had acid like this is highschool, we would all be better off! Itâ€™s like we crushed up sunlight, squirted a lime on it, then a dash of river stones, and there you have it. Bright bristling and so well balanced. This one will last a lifetime. 100 cases produced.</p>
