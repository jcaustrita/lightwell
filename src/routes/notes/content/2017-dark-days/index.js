			<p>Summer was made for escaping, trying to put aside worry and sticking with the same annual traditions like a family lake trip or the usual pale pink wine. That is until a typical summer day is brought to a halt by something unexpected, unidentified and darker. Darker Days was made to shake things up and bring rosé into a different light.</p>
			<p>We call this <i>Dark Days</i>: it’s our rosé, and it might be darker than one of our reds. But it’s the one that is half Riesling, so it’s okay. Pairs well with talking about Provence behind its back. 33 cases produced</p>
