			<p>A blend of 97% Cabernet Franc, 2% Petit Manseng, and 1% Riesling. It’s hard to stay a lone wolf for long, so you’ve got to stay looking over your shoulder as the weird ones are out there. It could be time to show a little teeth and let them know your bark isn’t worse than your bite. There are always new wolves in town equally hungry and equally weird. Don’t be afraid to let ‘em know who leads the pack.</p>
			<p>Beefy, juicy, spicy, and so so yummy! This one is soft and silky on the palette with a nice gravely acidity that cleans it right up. FRESHHHHHH to death. Currants, raspberry, and prunes are front runners while smokey wood and ash on the finish help balance it out. While the fruit is very pretty, its the spice that grabs ahold of you. There is a cedar clove element that shines through that is oh so elegant – oh so soft. Stay gold pony boy. 169 cases produced.</p>
