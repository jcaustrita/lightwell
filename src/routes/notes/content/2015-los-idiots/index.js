			<p>A blend of 51% Syrah and 49% Riesling. This is all about going for it. Following your passion even if you have no experience doing what your heart’s pulling for. Everyone’s going to look like a clown the first time they try something new, but after all, clowns are – in a way – professionals. And those big shoes come in handy when stomping grapes.</p>
			<p>At Lightwell Survey we’re careful not to take things too seriously. Hence, Los Idiots. It’s an uncommon blend of 51% Syrah and 49% Riesling. Winemaker Ben said “trust me” and we’re happy as hell we did. It’s a bottle full of fun. This wine is ready for taking a couple down – light on alcohol but heavy on drinkability. The nose is somewhere between tangerines and apple skins, and the palate is soft, supple and smooth. Perfect with a light chill with good friends. 48 cases produced.</p>
