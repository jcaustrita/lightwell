We have a new 'Strange Hybrid Moments' rosé plus two fruit wine collaborations, 'Night Moves' + 'We Are Not Noble'. This fruit wine was a collab with our friends at Troddenvale. Your ticket includes tastings of our latest and greatest chillable wines. We will have wine for sale and loads of pink for you. So please So come on out to the 'Boro and have some fun with us. The party will be outdoors in the sun with food available for purchase from local badass biscuit whiz from Staunton VA, Rachael Harris and Vagabond Belly.

			<p>The only way to get our new 2020 wines now is to pre-order for pickup on the 1st. Select “winery pickup” at check out. You can purchase the new 2020 rosé and our 2020 fruit wine collabs <a href="/shop">here</a>! If you can't make it and need us to ship the new juice to you we will start shipping after the event.</p>
