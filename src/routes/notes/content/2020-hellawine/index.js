			<p>We’re having a party on October 31th, which some may point out, is Halloween!</p>
			<p>We will be convening for the second time at our space in Waynesboro. Join us for a great day celebrating the release of our 2018 vintage in true Lightwell socially distanced style. Your ticket includes delicious grub and tastings of our latest and greatest wines. We will have wine for sale and a few surprises for you, look forward to seeing all y'all in "The Boro''. To ensure we can have Hellawine next year with 500 of our closest friends next year we are limiting our numbers and requiring tickets. Let’s keep everyone safe. Please purchase your ticket <a href="/shop">here</a>, we will have your name on our guestlist when you arrive! Please dress to be warm as the majority of the event will be in tents outside our space to ensure our socially distanced and drink filled afternoon.</p>
			<p>The only way to get our 2018s now is to pre-order for pickup on the 31st. Select “winery pickup” at check out. You can purchase the new 2018’s <a href="/shop">here</a>! If you can't make it and need us to ship the new juice to you we will start shipping the second week of November.</p>
			<p>Don’t want to scare anyone but our 2018 vintage is very limited so we will sell out quickly.</p>
			<p>We are offering our first series pack of Goodbye Horses featuring our 2015, 2016, 2018 Vintages. Rumour is there may be some of our earlier vintages available, not completely sure what's in the cellar. However, Hellawine will be the only chance to break into the vault. We will also have some other fun stuff to share with you so look for a completely new line of Schwag!</p>
