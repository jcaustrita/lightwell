			<p>We will be convening for the first time at our space in Waynesboro, VA to celebrate the release of our 2017s!  It’s a chance for our friends to join us, explore our new offerings and day party! Our neighbors who happen to be concrete artists and blacksmiths and glass blowers & chefs will be joining us. There will be plenty of Lightwell Survey available for tasting (for FREE) and purchase along with some new schwag. We are an indoor/outdoor spot so bring a jacket! Dogs (the friendly ones) and kids (the friendly ones) are welcome.</p>
